# Tic-Tac-Toe

Through guidance from Sean Allen's video, I've gained a better understanding on how to implement simple AI functions for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
I have also gained more knowledge on the implementation of `compactMap`, `filter`, and `map`.

To further my understanding, I might implement more functions and UI into the mix.
